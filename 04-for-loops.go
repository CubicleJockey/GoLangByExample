/*

for is Goâ€™s only looping construct. Here are three basic types of for loops.

The most basic type, with a single condition.

A classic initial/condition/after for loop.

for without a condition will loop repeatedly until you break out of the loop or return from the enclosing function.

You can also continue to the next iteration of the loop.
